# CSS Layout: From Basics to Responsive Design

## Introduction

Creating effective layouts is one of the most crucial aspects of modern web design. The way elements are positioned and arranged on a page significantly impacts user experience, readability, and accessibility. CSS provides a variety of layout techniques, from the traditional to the modern, each with specific use cases and advantages.

This guide explores the evolution of CSS layout methods, starting with basic concepts and progressing through various techniques like floats, positioning, flexbox, and grid. We'll also dive into responsive design principles that ensure your layouts adapt beautifully across different devices and screen sizes.

Understanding these layout methods will empower you to create designs that are both visually appealing and functionally robust, regardless of how users access your content.

## 1. CSS Layout Basics

Before diving into specific layout techniques, it's essential to understand how browsers naturally handle the positioning of elements on a page.

### Normal Flow

Normal flow (sometimes called document flow) is the default way browsers arrange elements on a webpage when no specific positioning instructions are given. Understanding normal flow provides the foundation for making intentional layout modifications.

In normal flow:

- **Block-level elements** (like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.) stack vertically, creating a new line before and after themselves. They typically occupy the full width of their parent container unless given a specific width.

- **Inline elements** (like `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, etc.) flow horizontally within the text of a document, only taking up as much width as necessary for their content. They don't create new lines before or after themselves.

- **Inline-block elements** (created with `display: inline-block`) behave like inline elements in terms of their external flow but like block elements for their internal formatting. They flow with text but can have width, height, padding, and margins.

Here's how normal flow looks in practice:

```html
<div class="container">
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph with <a href="#">an inline link</a> inside it.</p>
  <div>Another block element</div>
  <span>An inline element</span>
  <span>Another inline element on the same line</span>
</div>
```

The result would display:
- The `<h1>` as a block taking the full width of `.container`
- The `<p>` as another block taking full width, with the `<a>` flowing inline within it
- The next `<div>` as another full-width block
- Both `<span>` elements flowing horizontally in sequence

Understanding normal flow is crucial because all layout techniques essentially involve modifying this default behavior in some way.

### Modifying Flow with CSS Properties

Several CSS properties can change how elements are laid out:

- **`display`**: Changes the inner and outer display type of an element
  - `block`: Makes an element behave like a block
  - `inline`: Makes an element behave like an inline element
  - `inline-block`: A hybrid that flows with text but can have block properties
  - `none`: Removes the element from the flow completely
  - `flex` and `grid`: Creates specialized layout contexts (covered in later sections)

- **`float`**: Pushes an element to one side, allowing content to flow around it

- **`position`**: Changes how an element is positioned in the document
  - `static`: Default normal flow positioning
  - `relative`: Positioned relative to its normal position
  - `absolute`: Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
  - `fixed`: Positioned relative to the viewport
  - `sticky`: A hybrid of relative and fixed positioning

- **`margin`**, **`padding`**, and **`border`**: Affect spacing and size

Here's a simple demonstration of modifying flow:

```css
/* Convert elements to different display types */
.make-block {
  display: block;
}

.make-inline {
  display: inline;
}

/* Create space with margin */
.spaced {
  margin: 20px 0;
}

/* Hide an element completely */
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

As we explore each layout method in the following sections, we'll see how these properties interact to create complex arrangements of elements.

## 2. Floats

Floats were one of the earliest tools for creating multi-column layouts in CSS, though they've largely been replaced by newer techniques for complex layouts. However, they still serve important purposes in modern web design.

### Purpose and Use Cases

Floats were originally intended to allow text to wrap around images, similar to how magazines and newspapers position photographs within articles. This remains their most appropriate use case today.

Modern use cases for floats include:

- Floating images within text content
- Creating text wrapping effects like drop caps
- Floating pull quotes or information boxes within content
- Simple two-column layouts where content wrapping is desirable

### Basic Float Usage

The `float` property moves an element to the left or right of its container, allowing other content to flow around it.

```css
.float-left {
  float: left;
  margin-right: 15px; /* Space between the floated element and surrounding content */
}

.float-right {
  float: right;
  margin-left: 15px;
}
```

A classic example of appropriate float usage:

```html
<article>
  <img class="float-left" src="image.jpg" alt="Descriptive text">
  <p>This paragraph will wrap around the floated image on the left. This creates
  a layout similar to what you might see in a magazine or newspaper, where text
  flows naturally around images.</p>
</article>
```

### Clearing Floats

When elements are floated, they're partially removed from the normal document flow, which can lead to unexpected layout issues. One common problem is that containers with only floated elements inside them collapse to zero height, as if they were empty.

To solve this, we need to "clear" the floats. There are several techniques:

#### The `clear` Property

The `clear` property specifies which sides of an element should not be adjacent to floated elements:

```css
.clear-left {
  clear: left; /* No floating elements allowed on the left */
}

.clear-right {
  clear: right; /* No floating elements allowed on the right */
}

.clear-both {
  clear: both; /* No floating elements allowed on either side */
}
```

A common pattern is to add a cleared element at the end of a container:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="float-left">Floated element</div>
  <div class="float-right">Another floated element</div>
  <div class="clear-both"></div> <!-- Forces container to encompass floats -->
</div>
```

#### The `display: flow-root` Method

Modern CSS provides a cleaner solution with `display: flow-root`, which creates a new block formatting context that includes all floated children:

```css
.container {
  display: flow-root;
}
```

This is the recommended modern approach as it doesn't require additional markup.

#### The Clearfix Hack

Before `flow-root` was widely supported, developers used a technique called the "clearfix hack":

```css
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```

This adds a pseudo-element after the container and clears it.

### Historical Context: Floats for Layout

Before flexbox and grid, developers used floats to create multi-column layouts:

```css
.column {
  float: left;
  width: 33.33%;
}

.row::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">Column 1</div>
  <div class="column">Column 2</div>
  <div class="column">Column 3</div>
</div>
```

While this approach works, it has significant limitations:
- Equal height columns are difficult to achieve
- Vertical centering is complicated
- Reordering content is nearly impossible without changing the HTML
- Complex layouts require extensive calculations and nested floats

For these reasons, float-based layouts have been largely replaced by flexbox and grid, which we'll cover later.

## 3. Positioning

CSS positioning provides precise control over where elements appear on a page, sometimes independently of the normal document flow. Understanding the different positioning methods is crucial for creating specific layout effects and UI components.

### Static Positioning

`position: static` is the default positioning for all elements. Elements with static positioning are said to be "not positioned" and simply follow the normal document flow.

```css
.default {
  position: static;
}
```

Static elements are not affected by the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, or `z-index` properties.

### Relative Positioning

`position: relative` positions an element relative to where it would normally appear in the document flow.

Key characteristics of relative positioning:

- The element remains in the normal flow (its original space is preserved)
- Other elements behave as if the element were still in its original position
- The element can be offset using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties
- These offsets are calculated from the element's original position

```css
.relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;    /* Move down 20px from original position */
  left: 30px;   /* Move right 30px from original position */
}
```

Use cases for relative positioning:
- Making small adjustments to an element's position
- Creating a positioning context for absolutely positioned children
- Layering elements with `z-index`

### Absolute Positioning

`position: absolute` removes an element entirely from the normal document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with `position` set to anything other than `static`).

Key characteristics of absolute positioning:

- The element is removed from the normal flow (its original space collapses)
- Other elements behave as if the element doesn't exist
- Without a positioned ancestor, positioning is relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport)
- Offset properties (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`) are calculated from the positioned ancestor's padding box

```css
.container {
  position: relative; /* Creates positioning context */
  height: 300px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;    /* 20px from the top of .container */
  right: 30px;  /* 30px from the right of .container */
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="absolute">Positioned Element</div>
</div>
```

Use cases for absolute positioning:
- UI elements that need to be precisely placed (tooltips, badges, notifications)
- Elements that need to be positioned independently of content flow
- Overlays and modal dialogs
- Creating complex layouts where elements need to be layered

### Setting the Positioning Context

Understanding positioning context is crucial for using absolute positioning effectively:

```css
.outer {
  position: relative; /* Creates positioning context */
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.inner {
  position: relative; /* Creates nested positioning context */
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: #ddd;
  margin: 50px;
}

.absolute-to-inner {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: red;
}

.absolute-to-outer {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```

```html
<div class="outer">
  <div class="inner">
    <div class="absolute-to-inner">A</div>
  </div>
  <div class="absolute-to-outer">B</div>
</div>
```

In this example:
- Element A is positioned at the top-right of the inner div
- Element B is positioned at the bottom-left of the outer div

### Fixed Positioning

`position: fixed` positions an element relative to the viewport, so it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.

Key characteristics of fixed positioning:

- The element is removed from the normal flow
- Positioning is always relative to the viewport
- The element remains in place during scrolling
- Offset properties are calculated from the viewport edges

```css
.fixed-header {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: white;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  z-index: 1000;
}
```

Use cases for fixed positioning:
- Navigation bars that stay visible when scrolling
- "Back to top" buttons
- Persistent UI elements that should always be accessible

### Sticky Positioning

`position: sticky` is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relatively positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, then it's treated as fixed.

Key characteristics of sticky positioning:

- The element is in the normal flow until the scroll threshold is reached
- Requires at least one threshold value (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`)
- When the threshold is reached, the element "sticks" to that position
- The sticky element is constrained to its parent container

```css
.sticky-header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0; /* Sticks when the top of the element hits the top of the viewport */
  background-color: white;
  padding: 10px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

Use cases for sticky positioning:
- Section headers in long lists
- Navigation elements that should stick after scrolling past a certain point
- Table headers that remain visible while scrolling through data

### Z-Index and Stacking Context

When elements overlap due to positioning, the `z-index` property controls which elements appear on top.

Key points about `z-index`:

- Only works on positioned elements (not `static`)
- Higher values appear on top of lower values
- Elements with the same `z-index` are stacked according to their order in the HTML (later elements on top)
- Creates a stacking context, which affects how descendant elements are stacked

```css
.background {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  background-color: blue;
}

.foreground {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2; /* Will appear above .background */
  background-color: red;
}
```

Stacking contexts can become complex with nested positioned elements. Each positioned element with a `z-index` other than `auto` creates its own stacking context, affecting how its descendants are stacked relative to other elements.

## 4. Modern Layout Methods

Modern CSS layout methods like Flexbox and Grid provide powerful tools that solve many of the challenges that made layout difficult with older techniques. These methods are designed to create flexible, responsive layouts with less code and greater control.

### Comparing Traditional and Modern Methods

Before flexbox and grid, developers had to use various workarounds:

| Task | Traditional Method | Modern Method |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| Vertical centering | Absolute positioning with negative margins or transform tricks | `align-items: center` in flexbox or grid |
| Equal height columns | Background image hacks or JavaScript | Automatic in flexbox and grid |
| Reordering content | Changing HTML structure | `order` property in flexbox, or grid placement |
| Responsive layouts | Complex float-based systems with media queries | Intrinsically responsive with `fr` units and auto-placement |

### Simple Traditional Techniques Still Worth Knowing

Despite the power of modern layout methods, some traditional techniques remain useful for simple tasks:

#### Margin and Padding for Spacing

```css
.spaced {
  margin: 20px; /* Outer spacing */
  padding: 15px; /* Inner spacing */
}
```

#### Auto Margins for Centering

```css
.centered {
  width: 80%; /* Must have a width */
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  /* Shorthand: margin: 0 auto; */
}
```

### Flexbox

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is designed for one-dimensional layouts — either rows or columns. It excels at distributing space and aligning items within a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

#### When to Use Flexbox

Flexbox is ideal for:
- Navigation bars and menus
- Card layouts
- Centering content vertically and horizontally
- Distributing space between items
- Creating flexible form layouts
- Any design where items need to be aligned in a single row or column

#### Flex Container Basics

To create a flex container, use `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex`:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  /* Default: items arranged in a row */
}
```

#### Flex Terminology

Understanding flexbox requires familiarity with its terminology:

- **Flex container**: The element with `display: flex`
- **Flex items**: The direct children of the flex container
- **Main axis**: The primary axis along which flex items are arranged (horizontal for row, vertical for column)
- **Cross axis**: The perpendicular axis to the main axis
- **Main start/end**: The start and end of the main axis
- **Cross start/end**: The start and end of the cross axis

#### Flex Direction

Control the direction of the main axis:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;         /* Default: left to right */
  /* flex-direction: row-reverse; */  /* Right to left */
  /* flex-direction: column; */       /* Top to bottom */
  /* flex-direction: column-reverse; */ /* Bottom to top */
}
```

#### Wrapping Flex Items

Control whether items wrap onto new lines:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;      /* Default: single line, may overflow */
  /* flex-wrap: wrap; */        /* Multiple lines if needed */
  /* flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; */ /* Multiple lines in reverse order */
}
```

The shorthand `flex-flow` combines direction and wrap:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap; /* Direction followed by wrap */
}
```

#### Flexible Sizing

Flex items can grow or shrink based on available space:

```css
.flex-item {
  flex-grow: 1;   /* Grow factor (0 = don't grow) */
  flex-shrink: 1; /* Shrink factor (0 = don't shrink) */
  flex-basis: auto; /* Initial size before growing/shrinking */
}
```

The `flex` shorthand combines these properties:

```css
.flex-item {
  flex: 1;       /* 1 1 0% (grow, shrink, basis) */
  /* flex: 0 1 auto; */ /* Default */
  /* flex: 2; */        /* Grow twice as much as flex: 1 */
  /* flex: 0 0 200px; */ /* Fixed width, no growing or shrinking */
}
```

Common patterns:
- `flex: 1` - Equal sizing with ability to grow and shrink
- `flex: 0 0 auto` - Natural size without growing or shrinking
- `flex: 0 0 200px` - Fixed width regardless of container size

#### Alignment in Flexbox

Flexbox provides powerful alignment properties:

**Justify Content** (main axis alignment):

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;    /* Default: items at start */
  /* justify-content: flex-end; */      /* Items at end */
  /* justify-content: center; */        /* Items centered */
  /* justify-content: space-between; */ /* Items with space between */
  /* justify-content: space-around; */  /* Items with space around */
  /* justify-content: space-evenly; */  /* Items with equal space */
}
```

**Align Items** (cross axis alignment):

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: stretch;     /* Default: items stretch to fill container */
  /* align-items: flex-start; */ /* Items aligned to start */
  /* align-items: flex-end; */   /* Items aligned to end */
  /* align-items: center; */     /* Items centered */
  /* align-items: baseline; */   /* Items aligned by text baseline */
}
```

**Align Content** (alignment of multiple lines):

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: flex-start;    /* Lines packed at start */
  /* align-content: flex-end; */      /* Lines packed at end */
  /* align-content: center; */        /* Lines centered */
  /* align-content: space-between; */ /* Lines with space between */
  /* align-content: space-around; */  /* Lines with space around */
  /* align-content: stretch; */       /* Default: lines stretch to fill */
}
```

**Individual Item Alignment**:

```css
.special-item {
  align-self: center; /* Override container's align-items for this item */
}
```

#### Changing Item Order

The `order` property changes the visual order of flex items without changing the HTML:

```css
.first {
  order: -1; /* Appears before items with higher order values */
}

.middle {
  order: 0;  /* Default value */
}

.last {
  order: 1;  /* Appears after items with lower order values */
}
```

#### Practical Flexbox Example

A responsive card layout:

```css
.card-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 20px; /* Modern spacing between items */
}

.card {
  flex: 1 0 300px; /* Grow, don't shrink, minimum 300px */
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

```html
<div class="card-container">
  <div class="card">Card 1</div>
  <div class="card">Card 2</div>
  <div class="card">Card 3</div>
  <div class="card">Card 4</div>
</div>
```

This creates cards that are at least 300px wide, grow to fill available space, and wrap to new rows as needed.

### CSS Grid

CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts — rows and columns simultaneously. It provides powerful control over both dimensions, making it ideal for overall page layouts and complex component designs.

#### When to Use Grid

Grid is ideal for:
- Overall page layouts
- Complex component layouts requiring alignment in both dimensions
- Gallery and image grid layouts
- Areas where content needs to be placed precisely in both dimensions
- Dashboard layouts
- Any design with a clear grid structure

#### Grid Container Basics

To create a grid container, use `display: grid` or `display: inline-grid`:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}
```

#### Grid Terminology

Key grid concepts include:

- **Grid container**: The element with `display: grid`
- **Grid items**: The direct children of the grid container
- **Grid lines**: The horizontal and vertical dividing lines
- **Grid tracks**: The rows and columns of the grid
- **Grid cells**: The individual units within the grid (like table cells)
- **Grid areas**: Named regions spanning multiple grid cells

#### Defining Grid Rows and Columns

Create the structure of your grid by defining tracks:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 2fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 300px auto;
}
```

This creates:
- Three columns: a fixed 200px column, followed by a flexible column, followed by another flexible column twice as wide as the previous one
- Three rows: two auto-sized rows with a 300px fixed height row in the middle

#### The Fr Unit

The `fr` unit represents a fraction of the available space:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* 25% - 50% - 25% split */
}
```

The `fr` unit enables flexible layouts without needing to calculate percentages.

#### Using minmax()

The `minmax()` function sets a minimum and maximum size:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(200px, 1fr) 2fr; /* First column between 200px and 1fr */
}
```

This is particularly useful for responsive layouts, ensuring columns don't become too narrow.

#### Repeat Function

The `repeat()` function creates repeated track patterns:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Three equal columns */
  /* Same as: grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; */
  
  /* Or with a pattern: */
  /* grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr 2fr); */
  /* Same as: grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr 2fr; */
}
```

#### Auto-Fill and Auto-Fit

Create responsive grids that automatically adjust the number of columns:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  /* Creates as many 200px+ columns as will fit */
}
```

`auto-fill` vs `auto-fit`:
- `auto-fill`: Creates as many tracks as will fit, even empty ones
- `auto-fit`: Creates as many tracks as needed and collapses empty ones

#### Grid Gaps

Add spacing between grid items:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  column-gap: 20px;
  row-gap: 30px;
  /* Shorthand: gap: 30px 20px; (row column) */
  /* Or equal gaps: gap: 20px; */
}
```

#### Positioning Items on the Grid

Place items precisely using line numbers:

```css
.grid-item {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 3;
  grid-row-start: 2;
  grid-row-end: 4;
}
```

Shorthand syntax:

```css
.grid-item {
  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* start / end */
  grid-row: 2 / 4;
  
  /* Or using span: */
  /* grid-column: 1 / span 2; */ /* Start at 1, span 2 columns */
  /* grid-row: 2 / span 2; */
}
```

Further shorthand:

```css
.grid-item {
  grid-area: 2 / 1 / 4 / 3; /* row-start / column-start / row-end / column-end */
}
```

#### Named Grid Areas

Create a visual layout with named areas:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar content"
    "footer footer";
  gap: 20px;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.header { grid-area: header; }
.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
.content { grid-area: content; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }
```

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <header class="header">Header</header>
  <aside class="sidebar">Sidebar</aside>
  <main class="content">Main Content</main>
  <footer class="footer">Footer</footer>
</div>
```

#### Alignment in Grid

Grid offers similar alignment properties to flexbox:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  
  /* Align all grid items horizontally */
  justify-items: center; /* start, end, center, stretch (default) */
  
  /* Align all grid items vertically */
  align-items: center; /* start, end, center, stretch (default) */
  
  /* Align the entire grid horizontally within its container */
  justify-content: center; /* start, end, center, stretch, space-around, space-between, space-evenly */
  
  /* Align the entire grid vertically within its container */
  align-content: center; /* start, end, center, stretch, space-around, space-between, space-evenly */
}

/* Individual item alignment overrides */
.grid-item {
  justify-self: start; /* Override horizontal alignment */
  align-self: end;     /* Override vertical alignment */
}
```

#### Practical Grid Example

A responsive photo gallery:

```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}

.gallery-item {
  height: 300px;
  overflow: hidden;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.gallery-item img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover; /* Maintain aspect ratio while filling area */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.gallery-item:hover img {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

```html
<div class="gallery">
  <div class="gallery-item"><img src="image1.jpg" alt="Gallery image"></div>
  <div class="gallery-item"><img src="image2.jpg" alt="Gallery image"></div>
  <!-- More items... -->
</div>
```

This creates a responsive gallery where images automatically arrange themselves based on the available space.

## 5. Responsive Design

Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures content looks and functions well across different devices and screen sizes. Rather than creating separate versions of a site for different devices, responsive design adapts a single version to work everywhere.

### Core Principles of Responsive Design

1. **Fluid grids**: Using relative units like percentages or `fr` instead of fixed pixels
2. **Flexible images and media**: Ensuring media scales within its container
3. **Media queries**: Applying different styles based on device characteristics
4. **Mobile-first approach**: Designing for small screens first, then enhancing for larger ones

### Media Queries

Media queries allow you to apply CSS rules conditionally based on the characteristics of the device or browser viewport.

#### Basic Syntax

```css
@media media-type and (condition) {
  /* CSS rules that apply when the condition is true */
}
```

Common media types:
- `screen`: For computer screens, tablets, and smartphones
- `print`: For printed documents and print previews
- `all`: Default, for all media types

Common conditions:
- `width`, `min-width`, `max-width`: Viewport width
- `height`, `min-height`, `max-height`: Viewport height
- `orientation`: Portrait or landscape
- `aspect-ratio`: Width-to-height ratio
- `resolution`: Pixel density

#### Width-Based Media Queries

The most common type of media query targets viewport width:

```css
/* Styles for screens narrower than 768px */
@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {
  .container {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}

/* Styles for screens between 768px and 1023px */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px) {
  .container {
    padding: 20px;
  }
}

/* Styles for screens 1024px and wider */
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container {
    padding: 30px;
  }
}
```

#### Mobile-First Approach

The mobile-first approach means starting with styles for small screens and then adding complexity for larger screens:

```css
/* Base styles for all devices */
.container {
  padding: 10px;
}

/* Additional styles for medium screens and up */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 20px;
    max-width: 750px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}

/* Additional styles for large screens */
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container {
    padding: 30px;
    max-width: 980px;
  }
}
```

Benefits of the mobile-first approach:
- Prioritizes content for smaller screens, where space is limited
- Progressive enhancement leads to better performance
- Forces designers to focus on essential content and functionality
- Typically results in simpler, more focused code
- Aligns with the reality that most web traffic comes from mobile devices

#### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are the viewport widths at which your layout changes. Rather than targeting specific devices, set breakpoints based on where your content needs adjustment:

```css
/* Small devices (portrait phones) */
/* Base styles - no media query */

/* Medium devices (landscape phones, small tablets) */
@media (min-width: 576px) {
  /* Medium device styles */
}

/* Large devices (tablets, small laptops) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Large device styles */
}

/* Extra large devices (laptops, desktops) */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  /* Extra large device styles */
}

/* Ultra large devices (large desktops, TV) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  /* Ultra large device styles */
}
```

Common breakpoint ranges:
- 320px-576px: Mobile phones
- 577px-768px: Large phones, small tablets
- 769px-992px: Tablets, small laptops
- 993px-1200px: Laptops, desktops
- 1201px+: Large desktops, TVs

However, it's better to set breakpoints based on your content rather than specific devices. Look for points where your layout starts to break or look awkward, and add media queries there.

### Responsive Layouts with Modern CSS

Modern layout tools like Flexbox and Grid are inherently responsive:

#### Responsive Flexbox

```css
.card-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.card {
  flex: 1 1 300px; /* Grow, shrink, basis */
  margin: 10px;
  /* Card styles */
}
```

This creates cards that:
- Are at least 300px wide
- Will grow to fill available space
- Will wrap to new lines as needed

#### Responsive Grid

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates a grid that:
- Automatically adjusts the number of columns based on available width
- Ensures columns are at least 250px wide
- Distributes remaining space equally

### Flexible Images and Media

Make images and media responsive:

```css
img, video, canvas, svg {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

For background images:

```css
.hero {
  background-image: url('small-hero.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  height: 50vh;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .hero {
    background-image: url('medium-hero.jpg');
    height: 60vh;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .hero {
    background-image: url('large-hero.jpg');
    height: 70vh;
  }
}
```

### The Viewport Meta Tag

The viewport meta tag ensures proper rendering on mobile devices:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

This essential tag:
- Sets the viewport width to match the device width
- Sets the initial zoom level to 1 (no zoom)
- Prevents mobile browsers from rendering pages at desktop widths and then scaling them down

#### Additional Options

The viewport meta tag can include other parameters:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0">
```

**Important:** Never use `user-scalable=no` as it prevents users from zooming, which is a serious accessibility issue. Users should always be able to zoom in for better readability, especially those with visual impairments.

### Responsive Typography

Make text adapt to different screen sizes:

#### Using Relative Units

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px; /* Base font size */
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem; /* 32px based on base font */
}

p {
  font-size: 1rem; /* 16px based on base font */
  line-height: 1.5;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px; /* Larger base font for larger screens */
  }
}
```

#### Fluid Typography with Viewport Units

```css
h1 {
  font-size: calc(1.5rem + 2vw); /* Scales smoothly with viewport width */
}
```

This creates text that scales proportionally with the viewport, without needing multiple media queries.

### Testing Responsive Designs

Tools for testing responsive designs:

1. **Browser DevTools**: Most browsers have responsive design mode or device emulation
2. **Real Devices**: Test on actual phones, tablets, and computers when possible
3. **Online Services**: Tools like BrowserStack allow testing on various devices
4. **Responsive Design Checkers**: Websites that show your site at different viewport sizes simultaneously

When testing, check for:
- Text readability at all sizes
- Touch targets large enough for mobile (at least 44×44px)
- Content visibility without horizontal scrolling
- Proper stacking/reordering of content
- Load times on mobile connections
